# Housing Price Predictor
Building a model of housing prices in California using the California census data.

This project applies Supervised Learning to a regression task. 
The objective is to practice data science by using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
In this project I'm particularly interested in using Pipelines, cross validation, and some useful Sklearn transformers and estimators.
